Accelerated courses and workshops in Generative AI for experienced developers. The world is changing, stay ahead of the curve.

## Our Flagship Course: Practical LLM Bootcamp for Developers

A 6-week intensive program that takes you from LLM basics to building production-ready AI applications. Perfect for senior developers who want to architect and implement real-world generative AI solutions.

This is an accelerated course for senior developers to architect and build solutions that leverage generative AI (mostly large langugage models), although we'll also be able to leverage audio and image models.

There are a wide range of solutions that you'll be able to build after this course:

- A customer support bot
- Semantic email search
- Medical or legal literature research bot
- Workflow automation with unstructured data
- Q&A bot for internal company documents or codebases
- YouTube or Podcast semantic search
- Automated student homework grader
- Lots more!

In order to build these solutions, we'll get hands-on with the major concepts, techniques and tools in the LLM world: RAG, Agents, fine-tuning, hosting/inference, Hugging Face, Pinecone, Chainlit, etc.

Most importantly, by the end of the course, you'll have meaningful intuition for what tasks are easy vs hard for models, what model family or size to use, token rate and cost, etc. You will feel comfortable designing solutions that orchestrate a variety of agents and tools.

## Weekly Topics

**Week 1: Prompt design and evaluation.** LLM solutions are non-deterministic, and the majority of challenges are in moving from an 80% working prototype to a production system. This makes evaluation design and monitoring an essential component.

**Week 2: Embeddings & RAG**. LLM solutions need to fetch context from the outside world (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Embeddings and vector databases are new tools, but practical solutions will require a fusion with traditional search indexing.

**Week 3: Tools**. In order to delegate and act in the real world, LLM models will utilize specialized tools to interact with APIs.

**Week 4: Agents.** Composing solutions will require breaking tasks into smaller scopes, and using various planning and supervisory techniques to navigate a dynamic world.

**Week 5: Fine-tuning.** Fine-tuning is only required when moving from a prototype to production to increase consistency and reduce cost.

**Week 6: Implementing GPT + Demo day.** We'll give a high-level (although still hands-on) tour of implementing the underlying transformer architecture with Pytorch.

Note: we'll cover some amount of the underlying deep learning concepts, but this course focuses on application design.

## Class Structure

- 6 weeks of classes
- Each week has one 2-hour session
- Each week has 5-10 hours of additional project work (most spending closer to 10 hours)
- You will also choose either an individual or group capstone project to build an app of your own design. This is included in the 5-10 hours of weekly project work.

## Prework

To get warmed up, we have a pre-work before the first day that takes 1-2 hours. You'll quickly build a custom chat bot with OpenAI, and you'll also learn how to power the bot using an open source LLM model that you deploy. You'll also be able to explore what LLM vision models can do now.

If you're deciding if this course is right for you, consider giving the prework a try.

## Cost

The cost for the 6-week course is $3000.
